#Operators

# 1.Arithmatic Operators
# a = 20
# b = 7
# print("The addition is ", a+b)
# print("The subtraction is ", a-b)
# print("The multiplication is ", a*b)
# print("The division is ", a/b)
# print("The remainder is ", a%b)
# print("The floor division result is ", a//b)
# print("The exponentiation result is ", a**b)

# 2.Assignment Operators
# c = 10
# c == 10
# print(c)
# c += 12
# print(c)
# c -= 2
# print(c)
# c *= 4
# print(c)
# c /= 5
# print(c)
# c %= 6
# print(c)
# c **= 3
# print(c)
# c //= 3
# print(c)

# 3.Comparison Operators

# d = 70
# e = 23
# print(d == e)
# print(d < e)
# print(d > e)
# print(d <= e)
# print(d >= e)
# print(d != e)

# 4.Logical Operators
l1 = 12
l2 = 14
print(l1 < l2 & l1 > l2)
# print(not(a > b))
